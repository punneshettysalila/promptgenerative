# AI-Powered Prompt Generator

A modern, frontend-only web tool to help users structure and refine prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, GPT-3+, and similar generative AI systems.

## Features

- **Simple and Intuitive UI:** Fill in context, instructions, examples, and your expected output.
- **Automated Prompt Assembly:** Instantly combines inputs into a ready-to-use prompt for LLMs.
- **Animated Gradient Background:** Eye-catching color transitions for a professional touch.
- **Prompt Engineering Tips:** Practical guidelines displayed for crafting more effective AI prompts.
- **Local Draft Saving:** Remembers your previous work through browser local storage.
- **Responsive Design:** Clean look, works on desktops and mobile devices.

## How It Works

1. Enter text into each prompt engineering field.
2. Click **Generate Prompt**—your inputs will be combined and displayed below.
